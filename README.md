## 🚀 Project Overview
**STARK** is a real-time video calling web application that enables seamless communication between multiple users with **low latency and high-quality streaming**.  
The app uses **WebRTC** for peer-to-peer media exchange and the **Agora SDK** for real-time signaling and scalability.

---

## 💡 Features
- 📞 **Real-time video and audio communication** using WebRTC  
- 👥 **Supports 10+ concurrent users** with low latency  
- 🎥 **Camera & Microphone toggles** for control during calls  
- 🔄 **Dynamic room creation and joining**  
- ✅ **User Acceptance Tested** — 95% satisfaction in manual and automated tests

## 🧠 How It Works
1. Users enter a **room code** to create or join a video call.  
2. WebRTC establishes **peer-to-peer connections** between clients.  
3. The **Agora SDK** handles signaling for connection setup and synchronization.  
4. Video and audio streams are exchanged directly between participants.  
5. User interface dynamically updates as participants join or leave.
